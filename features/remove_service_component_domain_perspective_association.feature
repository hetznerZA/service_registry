Feature: Removing service component associations from domain perspectives
  As a provisioner
  Given a service component
  And a domain perspective
  When a service component should no longer be associated with a domain perspective
  In order to have the service component not be listed as associated with the domain perspective
  I want to deregister the service component from the domain perspective
