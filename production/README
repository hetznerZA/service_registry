Download the correct juddi as expressed in the TFA README and uncompress it.
Delete webapps/juddi-gui and replace it with the Hetzner jUDDI GUI found in here: git@github.com:hetznerZA/soar_sr_gui.git
Clone this repo, build it and then do all GUI configuration to target/juddi-gui. Soft-link target/juddi-gui to the tomcat directory's webapps/juddi-gui and then follow the rest of these instructions.

Configure the juddi authenticator as in the TFA README

For production, configure the data source as follows to point to a relational database of your choice:

vi webapps/juddiv3/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/persistence.xml 

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="mysql"/>

vi juddiv3/META-INF/context.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Context>
    <WatchedResource>WEB-INF/web.xml</WatchedResource>
    <Resource name="jdbc/JuddiDS" auth="Container"
        type="javax.sql.DataSource" username="#{systemProperties['RDS_USERNAME']}" password="#{systemProperties['RDS_PASSWORD']}"
        driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
        url="jdbc:mysql://#{systemProperties['RDS_HOSTNAME']}:#{systemProperties['RDS_PORT']}/#{systemProperties['RDS_DB_NAME']}?autoReconnect=true"
        maxActive="20"/>
</Context>

Make sure mysql-connector-java-x.y.z.jar is in the juddiv3 war so:
cp <tomcat-dir>/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.jar webapps/juddiv3/WEB-INF/lib/

Now create the database and provide access:

create juddiv3
grant all ON juddi.* to `uddi`@`%` IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
flush privileges;

Make sure conf/CATALINA/localhost/juddiv3.xml does not exist from the tomcat root directory.

cd webapps
cd juddiv3
jar -cvf ../juddiv3.war *
cd ../juddi-gui
jar -cvf ../juddi-gui.war *

Note that there are 2 webapps to deploy to beanstalk.

Once deployed, configure a crontab to restart the juddi service daily. This is to avoid 'Could not send message' errors between juddi-gui and juddiv3 that emerge over time. Increasing the memory footprint on the tomcat did not help to prevent this. At some point we need to debug why this happens:

crontab -e
37 4 * * * tomcat /home/tomcat/juddi-tomcat-3.3.2/bin/catalina.sh stop
38 4 * * * tomcat /home/tomcat/juddi-tomcat-3.3.2/bin/catalina.sh start
