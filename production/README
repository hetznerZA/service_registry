I think it will boil down to: in the web-app's META-INF pointing:

    <!-- mysql 
    <Resource name="jdbc/JuddiDS" auth="Container"
            type="javax.sql.DataSource" username="root" password=""
            driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" 
            url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/juddiv3"
            maxActive="8" 
            />

cd webapps
cd juddiv3
jar -cvf ../juddiv3.war *
cd ../juddi-gui
jar -cvf ../juddi-gui.war *

Note that there are 2 webapps to deploy to beanstalk... can we do that on the same beanstalk instance?
