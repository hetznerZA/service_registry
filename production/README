Download the correct juddi as expressed in the TFA README and uncompress it.
Delete webapps/juddi-gui and replace it with the Hetzner jUDDI GUI found in here: git@github.com:hetznerZA/soar_sr_gui.git
Clone this repo, build it and then do all GUI configuration to target/juddi-gui. Soft-link target/juddi-gui to the tomcat directory's webapps/juddi-gui and then follow the rest of these instructions.

Configure the juddi-gui authenticator as in the TFA README

For production, configure the data source as follows to point to a relational database of your choice:

vi juddiv3/WEB-INF/lib/persistence.xml 

<property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="mysql"/>

vi juddiv3/META-INF/context.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Context>
    <WatchedResource>WEB-INF/web.xml</WatchedResource>
    <Resource name="jdbc/JuddiDS" auth="Container"
        type="javax.sql.DataSource" username="uddi" password="password"
        driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
        url="jdbc:mysql://IP:3306/juddiv3"
        maxActive="8"/>
</Context>

Make sure mysql-connector-java-x.y.z.jar is in the juddiv3 war so:
cp <tomcat-dir>/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6.jar webapps/juddiv3/WEB-INF/lib/

Now create the database and provide access:

create juddiv3
grant all ON juddi.* to `uddi`@`%` IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
flush privileges;

Make sure conf/CATALINA/localhost/juddiv3.xml does not exist from the tomcat root directory.

cd webapps
cd juddiv3
jar -cvf ../juddiv3.war *
cd ../juddi-gui
jar -cvf ../juddi-gui.war *

Note that there are 2 webapps to deploy to beanstalk... can we do that on the same beanstalk instance?
